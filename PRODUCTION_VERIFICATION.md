### üîß Troubleshooting Common Issues

#### Application Won't Start
```bash
# Check PM2 logs for startup errors
npx pm2 logs etrax-backend --err

# Verify environment variables
cat /var/www/etrax/backend/.env | grep -v "PASSWORD\|SECRET"

# Test database connection manually
cd /var/www/etrax/backend
node -e "require('./dist/config/database.js').testConnection()"
```

#### 502 Bad Gateway

# Check if backend is running
npx pm2 status

# Verify nginx configuration
sudo nginx -t

# Check nginx logs
sudo tail /var/log/nginx/error.log
```

#### Database Connection Errors
```bash
# Test PostgreSQL connection
psql -h localhost -U etrax_user -d etrax_production -c "SELECT NOW();"

# Check if database exists
psql -h localhost -U postgres -c "\l" | grep etrax
```
